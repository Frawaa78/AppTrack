# AppTrack Release Notes v2.6.1 - HOTFIX

**Release Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Type**: Critical Bug Fix  
**Priority**: High

## Overview

AppTrack v2.6.1 is a critical hotfix release that resolves a significant user experience issue with the Visual Diagram Editor introduced in v2.6.0. This release ensures seamless operation of integration diagrams without manual intervention.

## Bug Fix Details

### Issue: Visual Diagram Editor Arrow Disappearing
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: User workflow disruption  
**Affected Component**: Integration Architecture modal with visual diagram editor

**Problem Description**:
When users closed and reopened the integration diagram modal, visual arrows connecting diagram elements would disappear, requiring manual console commands to restore visibility. This created a poor user experience and interrupted diagram editing workflows.

**Root Cause**:
Modal reopening triggered SVG container recreation without proper arrow marker regeneration. The connection data was preserved but visual markers were lost during canvas reconstruction.

## Technical Solution

### Files Modified
1. **`/assets/js/components/visual-diagram-editor.js`**
   - Enhanced `loadFromMermaidCode()` method with automatic arrow recreation
   - Added `forceRecreateArrows()` public method for manual recovery
   - Improved SVG marker management during canvas recreation

2. **`/public/app_view.php`**
   - Added safeguard calls in modal reopen sequence
   - Integrated arrow recreation into diagram loading process
   - Enhanced error recovery for edge cases

### Implementation Details

#### Automatic Arrow Recreation
```javascript
// Added to loadFromMermaidCode() completion
if (this.connections.size > 0) {
    console.log('üîÑ Recreating all connections and markers after data load...');
    this.recreateAllConnectionsAndMarkers();
}
```

#### Public Recovery Method
```javascript
forceRecreateArrows() {
    if (this.connections.size > 0) {
        this.recreateAllConnectionsAndMarkers();
    }
}
```

#### Modal Event Integration
```php
// Enhanced modal reopen sequence
if (typeof visualEditor.forceRecreateArrows === 'function') {
    visualEditor.forceRecreateArrows();
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Arrows disappeared when reopening modal
- ‚ùå Required manual console commands: `visualEditor.recreateAllConnectionsAndMarkers()`
- ‚ùå Interrupted diagram editing workflow
- ‚ùå Unprofessional appearance with missing connections

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Arrows remain visible through modal close/reopen cycles
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention required
- ‚úÖ Seamless diagram editing experience
- ‚úÖ Professional visual quality maintained

## Testing Results

### Scenarios Tested
1. **Modal Close/Reopen**: Arrows persist correctly ‚úÖ
2. **Data Loading**: Automatic recreation works ‚úÖ  
3. **Multiple Connections**: All arrows restored ‚úÖ
4. **Edge Cases**: Manual method available ‚úÖ
5. **Cross-browser**: Consistent behavior ‚úÖ

### Performance Impact
- **Loading Time**: No significant impact
- **Memory Usage**: Negligible increase
- **User Interaction**: Improved responsiveness

## Backward Compatibility

This hotfix maintains full backward compatibility:
- ‚úÖ Existing diagrams load correctly
- ‚úÖ All previous functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ No database changes required
- ‚úÖ No configuration updates needed

## Deployment Notes

### Installation
No special installation steps required. Simply deploy the updated files:
- `assets/js/components/visual-diagram-editor.js`
