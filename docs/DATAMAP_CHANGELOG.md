# DataMap Development Changelog
*Detailed log of all changes made during the refactoring session*

## üìÖ Session: August 7, 2025

### üéØ Session Objectives
- Preserve all original DataMap functionality 
- Fix critical connection loss issue: "kun siste connection eller linje blir lagret ved refresh"
- Optimize performance issues with grip handles
- Prepare foundation for multi-architecture extension

---

## üîÑ Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Connection Preservation System (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: Multiple connections to same node disappeared after page refresh
**Files Modified**: `datamap-core.js`
**Functions Added**:
```javascript
saveNodeConnections(nodeId) // Preserve connections before node modification
restoreNodeConnections(nodeId, connections) // Rebuild connections after modification
```

**Technical Details**:
- Intelligent port mapping during node recreation
- Duplicate connection detection and prevention
- Cross-validation between input and output connections
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. DrawFlow Data Compatibility (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: DrawFlow crashes when importing array-format data
**Files Modified**: `datamap-core.js`
**Functions Added**:
```javascript
validateAndRepairDiagramData(diagramData) // Convert arrays to objects
repairConnectionConsistency(nodes) // Fix bidirectional connection integrity
```

**Technical Details**:
- Array-to-object conversion: `[node1, node2]` ‚Üí `{"1": node1, "2": node2}`
- Connection validation and automatic repair
- Data structure normalization for DrawFlow compatibility

### 3. Performance Optimization (PERFORMANCE FIX)
**Problem**: "Grip handles cleanup som virker som det kj√∏rer hele tiden...krever litt ressurser"
**Files Modified**: `datamap-core.js`
**Functions Modified**:
```javascript
removeGripHandles() // Added debouncing with 100ms timeout
```

**Technical Details**:
- Debounced DOM operations to reduce CPU usage
- Prevented redundant cleanup operations
- Optimized for smooth user interaction

### 4. Auto-Save Timing Coordination (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: Race condition where auto-save executed before connection restoration
**Files Modified**: `datamap-core.js`
**Functions Modified**:
```javascript
addNodeInput() // Added 1000ms setTimeout before autoSave()
addNodeOutput() // Added 1000ms setTimeout before autoSave()
removeNodeInput() // Added 1000ms setTimeout before autoSave()
removeNodeOutput() // Added 1000ms setTimeout before autoSave()
```

**Technical Details**:
- Delayed auto-save execution to allow connection restoration completion
- Prevents connections from being overwritten before restoration finishes
- Coordinated timing between node recreation and data persistence

## üîß Detailed Function Changes

### Connection Management Functions

#### `saveNodeConnections(nodeId)`
**Purpose**: Preserve all connections before node modification
**Logic**:
1. Extract all input connections with source mapping
2. Extract all output connections with target mapping  
3. Return structured connection data for restoration
4. Log preservation details for debugging

#### `restoreNodeConnections(nodeId, connections)`
**Purpose**: Rebuild connections after node recreation
**Logic**:
1. Validate that required ports exist on recreated node
2. Recreate each input connection using DrawFlow API
3. Recreate each output connection using DrawFlow API
4. Prevent duplicate connections during restoration
5. Update visual connection positions
6. Log restoration success/failure details

#### `repairConnectionConsistency(nodes)`
**Purpose**: Fix mismatched connections between nodes
**Logic**:
1. For each output connection, ensure target has matching input connection
2. For each input connection, ensure source has matching output connection
3. Add missing connection references where needed
4. Log all repair actions for transparency

### Data Validation Functions

#### `validateAndRepairDiagramData(diagramData)`
**Purpose**: Ensure data compatibility with DrawFlow
**Logic**:
1. Convert array-format nodes to object-format
2. Validate node structure and required properties
3. Repair missing or invalid connection arrays
4. Call connection consistency repair
5. Return sanitized data ready for DrawFlow import

### Performance Functions

#### `removeGripHandles()` (Modified)
**Purpose**: Clean up grip handles without performance impact
**Logic**:
1. Clear any existing cleanup timeout
2. Set new timeout for 100ms debounce
3. Perform actual grip removal in debounced callback
4. Prevent excessive DOM operations during user interaction

### Node Modification Functions

#### `addNodeInput(nodeId)` (Modified)
**Purpose**: Add input port to existing node
**Logic**:
1. Calculate current port counts
2. Recreate node with additional input port
3. **NEW**: Delay auto-save by 1000ms to allow connection restoration
4. Log operation success

#### `addNodeOutput(nodeId)` (Modified)
**Purpose**: Add output port to existing node  
**Logic**:
1. Calculate current port counts
2. Recreate node with additional output port
3. **NEW**: Delay auto-save by 1000ms to allow connection restoration
4. Log operation success

#### `removeNodeInput(nodeId)` (Modified)
**Purpose**: Remove input port from existing node
**Logic**:
1. Validate minimum port requirements
2. Recreate node with reduced input ports
3. **NEW**: Delay auto-save by 1000ms to allow connection restoration
4. Log operation success

#### `removeNodeOutput(nodeId)` (Modified)
**Purpose**: Remove output port from existing node
**Logic**:
1. Validate minimum port requirements  
2. Recreate node with reduced output ports
3. **NEW**: Delay auto-save by 1000ms to allow connection restoration
4. Log operation success

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Connection Loss After Refresh
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Auto-save executed before connection restoration completed
**Solution**: Added 1000ms setTimeout delay in all node modification functions
**Verification**: Multiple connections to same node now persist after refresh

### Issue #2: DrawFlow Import Crashes  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Array-format data incompatible with DrawFlow object expectations
**Solution**: Array-to-object conversion in validateAndRepairDiagramData()
**Verification**: No more import errors, smooth data loading

### Issue #3: Connection Data Inconsistency
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Missing bidirectional connection references
**Solution**: repairConnectionConsistency() function with comprehensive repair logic
**Verification**: All connections visible and functional after repair

### Issue #4: Performance Degradation
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: Excessive grip handle cleanup operations
**Solution**: Debounced removeGripHandles() with 100ms timeout
**Verification**: Smooth performance even with many nodes and frequent interactions

## üéØ Testing Results

### Test Case 1: Multiple Connections Preservation
**Scenario**: Create 3 nodes, add input to middle node, connect both outer nodes to middle node, refresh page
**Result**: ‚úÖ PASS - All connections preserved after refresh
**Evidence**: Console logs show successful connection restoration

### Test Case 2: Node Modification with Connections
**Scenario**: Create connection, add/remove ports, verify connection integrity
**Result**: ‚úÖ PASS - Connections maintained during port modifications
**Evidence**: Connections automatically restored after node recreation

### Test Case 3: Performance Under Load
