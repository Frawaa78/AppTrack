# DataMap Refactoring Guide
*Comprehensive documentation for AI-assisted continuation of DataMap development*

## 📋 Project Overview

**Primary Objective**: "Før vi begynner på multi architecture utvidelse, så ønsker jeg at de funksjonene som er i dag skal være tilstede"
- Preserve ALL original DataMap functionality while implementing UI/UX improvements
- Fix critical connection loss issue: "kun siste connection eller linje blir lagret ved refresh"
- Optimize performance issues with grip handles
- Prepare foundation for multi-architecture extension

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Maintain 100% functional compatibility with original DataMap while creating a robust, performance-optimized foundation for future multi-architecture features.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Connection Preservation System
**Problem Solved**: "De blå linjene connections linjene forsvinner" - connections disappeared after page refresh

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// Connection preservation during node recreation
saveNodeConnections(nodeId) → preserves connections before node modification
restoreNodeConnections(nodeId, connections) → rebuilds connections after node recreation
```

**Key Features**:
- Intelligent port mapping (input_1 → input_1, etc.)
- Duplicate connection detection and prevention
- Cross-validation between input and output connections
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 2. DrawFlow Data Compatibility
**Problem Solved**: DrawFlow crashes when importing array-format data

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
validateAndRepairDiagramData(diagramData) → converts arrays to objects
repairConnectionConsistency(nodes) → ensures bidirectional connection integrity
```

**Technical Details**:
- Array-to-object conversion: `[node1, node2]` → `{"1": node1, "2": node2}`
- Connection validation and repair
- Data structure normalization

### 3. Performance Optimization
**Problem Solved**: "Grip handles cleanup som virker som det kjører hele tiden på siden...virker som det krever litt ressurser"

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// Debounced grip handle removal
let gripCleanupTimeout;
removeGripHandles: function() {
    if (gripCleanupTimeout) clearTimeout(gripCleanupTimeout);
    gripCleanupTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        // Actual cleanup with performance optimization
    }, 100);
}
```

### 4. Auto-Save Timing Coordination
**Problem Solved**: Race condition where auto-save executed before connection restoration completed

**Solution Implemented**:
```javascript
// Delayed auto-save in all node modification functions
setTimeout(() => {
    this.autoSave();
}, 1000); // Wait for connection restoration to complete
```

## 🔍 Key Technical Insights

### 1. DrawFlow Library Characteristics
- **Requires object-format data**: `{"1": node1}` not `[node1]`
- **Bidirectional connections**: Both input and output sides must have connection references
- **In-place node modification**: Cannot change port count without recreation
- **Event-driven architecture**: Must use DrawFlow events for state management

### 2. Connection Data Structure
```javascript
// Output side connection
node.outputs.output_1.connections = [
    { node: "targetNodeId", output: "input_1" }
]

// Input side connection (must match!)
targetNode.inputs.input_1.connections = [
    { node: "sourceNodeId", input: "output_1" }
]
```

### 3. Timing Dependencies
- Connection restoration takes ~500-800ms
- Auto-save must wait 1000ms after node recreation
- DOM updates require 100ms debounce for performance
- Visual updates should be batched for efficiency

## 🛠️ Development Patterns

### Code Organization
```
DataMapCore = {
    // Core initialization
    init() → Setup DrawFlow, load data, bind events
    
    // Node management
    addNode() → Create new nodes
    deleteNode() → Remove nodes with connection cleanup
    recreateNodeWithPorts() → Modify node structure
    
    // Connection management
    saveNodeConnections() → Preserve connections
    restoreNodeConnections() → Rebuild connections
    repairConnectionConsistency() → Fix data issues
    
    // Performance optimization
    removeGripHandles() → Debounced cleanup
    updateAllConnectionPositions() → Batch updates
    
    // Data management
    validateAndRepairDiagramData() → Ensure data integrity
    autoSave() → Persistent storage
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Comprehensive logging for all operations
- Graceful fallbacks for data corruption
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic data repair when possible

### Performance Strategy
- Debounced operations for frequently called functions
- Batch DOM updates to minimize reflow
- Lazy loading of complex operations
- Memory leak prevention

2. **Layer Switching**: UI controls to switch between architecture layers
3. **Shared Nodes**: Nodes that appear across multiple layers
4. **Layer-Specific Connections**: Different connection types per layer
5. **Export/Import**: Multi-layer diagram persistence

### Implementation Strategy
1. Extend existing node structure to support layers
2. Add layer management UI components
3. Implement layer-aware connection system
4. Create layer switching animations
5. Maintain full backward compatibility

### Success Criteria
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Smooth layer transitions
