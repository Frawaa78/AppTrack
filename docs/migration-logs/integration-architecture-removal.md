- Fixed orphaned API references

## Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT**: Execute the following SQL to complete the removal:

```sql
-- Remove Integration Architecture Database Columns
ALTER TABLE applications DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS integration_diagram;
ALTER TABLE applications DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS integration_notes;
```

Location: `/workspaces/AppTrack/database_migrations/remove_integration_architecture.sql`

## System Impact

**Preserved Functionality:**
