# AppTrack

**AppTrack** is a web-based application management tool developed for the Yggdrasil project in Aker BP. Its purpose is to replace manual spreadsheets and fragmented documentation by offering a centralized and structured application registry.

---

## üéØ Objective

The goal is to build a modular full-stack web application using:

- **PHP** (backend)
- **MySQL** (database)
- **Bootstrap** (frontend)

The system enables users to register, update, and view relevant information about applications that are part of or affected by the Yggdrasil project. It is designed to scale and evolve, supporting new fields and future integrations, such as:

- **ServiceNow CMDB** integration (Aker BP)
- **Entra ID** authentication
- **ChatGPT** for AI-enhanced functionality

---

## üîë Key Features

  - `Short Description`: Application name
  - `Application Service`: Linked to ServiceNow CMDB
  - `Relevant for`: Indicates if the application is relevant for Yggdrasil
